  <h1> The Anderson-Darling Test: Theoretical Analysis </h1>
</div>   

## Overview  
This project provides a **detailed summary** of the construction steps of the Anderson-Darling test, a goodness-of-fit statistical test used to evaluate whether a sample follows a given probability distribution.  

The study is based on the foundational papers by **T.W. Anderson and D.A. Darling**, exploring the test's construction, its asymptotic properties, and its applications.  

## Report Content  
The document covers:  
- **Historical background and evolution** of the test since its creation in 1954.  
- **Mathematical construction** of the test.  
- **Comparison with other** goodness-of-fit statistical tests.  
- **Advantages and limitations** of the Anderson-Darling test.
